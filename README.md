Data analysis of a Shopping Behavior dataset using Power BI to uncover insights into customer purchasing patterns.

This project explores a Shopping Behavior dataset to uncover customer purchasing trends and provide actionable insights for businesses. Using Excel for initial data preparation and Power BI for interactive dashboards (with DAX measures), the analysis transforms raw data into meaningful business intelligence.

# Tools & Technologies

Excel → Data cleaning, preprocessing, and basic exploration

Power BI → Dashboard creation, data modeling, and DAX measures for calculated insights

# Key Insights

Male customers contribute more to sales than female customers.

Clothing dominates as the top-selling category, while outerwear shows growth potential.

Middle-aged customers (46–65 years) are the most significant spenders.

Fall generates the highest sales, while Summer records the lowest.

Subscriptions and loyalty programs show high adoption rates, indicating strong customer engagement.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates that data-driven insights can shape better business decisions. Male customers and middle-aged groups drive most sales, clothing dominates purchases, and seasonal shifts strongly influence demand. Businesses can leverage these findings to design targeted marketing campaigns, optimize inventory, and strengthen loyalty programs.

By combining Excel’s flexibility with Power BI’s visualization power, this project highlights how simple datasets can be transformed into strategic tools for growth.
